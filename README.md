# Knowledgify Extension on Object Detection Models
---

### Things to do:

- [ ] Train with default current setup (mbv2 ssdlite with coco weights on coco dataset)
- [ ] Train (faster_rcnn_resnet50_coco or nasnet)
- [ ] Train MobileNetV2 with faster rcnn (maybe?)
- [ ] Train distillation with no augmentation
- [ ] Train distillation with classical augmentation
- [ ] Train distillation with mixup
- [ ] Train distillation with manifold mixup
